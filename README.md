This is a chapter of my dissertation that is published as Stemle, L.R.*, Rothermel, B. and Searcy C. (2022). Assessment of Immature Gopher Tortoise Spatial Ecology Using GPS and Camera Trap Technology. Journal of Herpetology. 56: 172-179. The paper is avalibale on ResearchGate at https://www.researchgate.net/publication/362639434_GPS_Technology_Reveals_Larger_Home_Ranges_for_Immature_Gopher_Tortoises

We used GPS tags and got data from 6 tortoises that we analyzed with various types of home ranges. Attached is some of the code to convert GPS points to UTMs and the data that I entered into it.
