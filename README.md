# Immature_GT_GPS

This is a chapter of my dissertation that is published as Stemle, L.R.*, Rothermel, B. and Searcy C. (2022). Assessment of Immature Gopher Tortoise Spatial Ecology Using GPS and Camera Trap Technology. Journal of Herpetology. 56: 172-179.

We used GPS tags and got data from 6 tortoises that we analyzed with various types of home ranges. Attached is some of the code to convert GPS points to UTMs and the data that I entered into it.
